## Artisan Unofficial Apis
This repo contains a simple version of artisan apis, written in Go, in few hours for fun. I've never used go so it was interesting learning it while making this.

Please note that the only file you need is artisan.go but you also find an example of how the api should be used inside main.go, all the documentation needed it's written inside the files.

### Features
- Products fetching (with all the products details), you can use it to check if a product comes back in stock

### Disclaimers
This repository lacks of every good programming sense it's made for fun so don't open issues please. If you are willing to use it download it and modify it if something doesn't work.
